# advent-of-code-2024

This repository contains my personal (and incomplete) solutions to Advent of Code 2023, covering Days 1 through 25. Each day's challenge has two parts:
```
Part 1 is implemented in a.py
Part 2 is implemented in b.py
```
Both parts read input from a shared file named **data.txt**. The data.txt files contain my personal puzzle inputs. If you want to try solving the problems yourself, I recommend using your own input, which you can get from [your Advent of Code account](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

## Structure
```
day-xy/
├── a.py       # Solution for Part 1
├── b.py       # Solution for Part 2
└── data.txt   # Puzzle input for the day
```

## Progress
Not every day is solved:
```
day 15 part 2 -> Incorrect
day 16 part 2 -> Missing
day 17 part 2 -> Missing
day 20
day 21
day 22
day 23 part 2 -> Missing
day 24 part 2 -> Missing
day 25 part 2 -> missing
```
